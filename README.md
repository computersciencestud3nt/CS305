Artemis Financial

Artemis Financial was the client for this course project. The company provides financial services and required a secure software solution to protect sensitive customer data transmitted over the web. The primary issue Artemis Financial wanted addressed was identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities within their Java-based web application, particularly risks related to insecure dependencies, weak encryption, and unsafe communication channels.

I believe the strength of my vulnerability assessment was my ability to systematically analyze the application using both manual review and automated security tools. Secure coding is critical because vulnerabilities can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and damage to a company’s reputation. 

The most challenging but helpful part of the vulnerability assessment was analyzing dependency vulnerabilities using automated scanning tools. Interpreting the results required careful judgment to determine which vulnerabilities were relevant and which posed the greatest risk. This process reinforced the importance of prioritizing threats based on impact and exploitability rather than treating all findings equally.

I increased the application’s security by implementing multiple layers of protection, including secure communication through HTTPS, stronger cryptographic algorithms, dependency management, and input validation. 
To ensure the application remained functional and secure after refactoring, I ran the application, executed automated dependency scans, and verified that security enhancements did not break existing functionality. Re running vulnerability scans after changes helped confirm that no new vulnerabilities were introduced during refactoring.

Throughout this project, I relied on tools and practices such as Maven, OWASP Dependency-Check, Java security libraries, and secure coding standards. These resources will be valuable in future coursework and professional development, as they reflect industry-standard approaches to building secure software.

For future employers, I would showcase the completed vulnerability assessment report and the secure refactored code produced during this assignment. These artifacts demonstrate my ability to analyze software security risks, apply secure coding practices, use professional security tools, and document findings clearly—skills that are essential for roles in software development and cybersecurity.
